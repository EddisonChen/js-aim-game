AimField, ReflexField, two JavaScript browser aim games.

Inspired by Aimlabs, AImField is a game in which the player clicks on as many blue targets as possible within 30 seconds to get your score. The targets appear on the screen in sets of three, each time a target is clicked, it disappears and is replaced by a random target somewhere else on the screen. Each target stays on screen until clicked. Points are gained by clicking on targets accurately, and lost when clicking inaccurately 

The alternate game mode is ReflexField, in which the objective is to click each golden target that appears as many time as possible. Each pair of red and gold targets appears on screen for 1 second.

Made with JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.

The game is deployed at https://eddisonchen.github.io/js-aim-game/index.html
